1 reset upper end of F_reporting_ages to be nages-2  
2 NOTE: This model has just one settlement event. Changing to recr_dist_method 4 and removing the recruitment distribution parameters at the end of the MG parms section (below growth parameters) will produce identical results and simplify the model.
3 Maximum pop size bin:_120; is within 5% of L at maxage for sex: 1; Gpat: 1 settle: 1; L= 114.199
4 1st iteration warning: ssb(endyr)/ssb(styr)= 0.00670531; suggest start with larger R0 to get near 0.4; or use depletion fleet option
5 1st iteration warning: catch logL > 50% total logL; check configuration; suggest start with larger R0
6 Final gradient: 0.000211836 is larger than final_conv: 0.0001
N warnings: 6
